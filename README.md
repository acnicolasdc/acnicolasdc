## Hi There 👋 
I’ve been a software developer for over 5 years.

I'm a multimedia engineer with strong knowledge in software architecture and
UX, specialized in Web Frontend and Backend Development.

### Why acnicolasdc?
I grew up looking to my dad play the drums, and before I became a Sofware Developer, I dreamed to be a Rock Star like Angus Young from **AC/DC** 🤘, but after maybe two years of playing the drums, I knew the software world and I fell in love!. Now I'm Rock Star but of the Sotware world 💻 ! and the music, my hobbie and my soothing when the bugs🐞 are very stranges!
